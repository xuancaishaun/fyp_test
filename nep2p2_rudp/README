This folder contains rudp-based NeP2P v_a16.

The following files are modified:
1. lib/appsocket.py 
	-> client sends internal messages to the internal_gateway
	-> client's socket is changed to rudpSocket
2. lib/gateway.py
	-> super class for internal_gateway and external_gateway
	-> changed to rudpSocket

We intend to adjust rudpSocket to accommodate NeP2P a16

Update greenlet and gevent:
1. sudo pip install greenlet==dev
2. sudo pip install cython -e git://github.com/surfly/gevent.git#egg=gevent
